1. I coded a Platform game animated in Python using Visual Studio Code. I used for loops and functions to create a pixel-perfect collision animated game with sprite sheet and masks. 

In the game I:
- generated a background using the functions def get_background and def draw
- created a player using the class function with def __init__ and def move to be able to move the player left or right
- added gravity using loops to imitate the act of falling / jumping
- moved the player with animations by loading and splitting sprite sheets
- adding terrain that the player is able to collide with
- I added a scrolling background using the offset function

2. Once my animation was done, I linked VS Code to GitHub and pushed the file to my Github repository.

3. After uploading the file I created a resource group on Azure to host my new project. I created a Linux Web App using a Python 3.7 Runtime Stack, within the resource group, to host my Python App.

4. I linked Azure DevOps to my GitHub account and imported the repository from GitHub into Azure DevOps Repos

5. In Azure DevOps I used Pipelines to deploy the code onto Azure. I selected Azure Repos Git as the location of my code and selected my repository. I configured my pipeline using the "Python to Linux Web App on Azure" option. In the generated YAML file, I kept the trigger as "main" so if any changes were made in the repos, it would continuously integrate the pipeline.
